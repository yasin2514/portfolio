          You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

          goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web

            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
